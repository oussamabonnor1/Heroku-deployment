## Frontend
### Why?:
    I added a frontend to the flask app to test my newly acquired skills!

### How to navigate the website?:
    The home page contains the emails and passwords for premade accounts with different roles.
    Write them into the (mail/password) fields in the auth0 login page
    * You can login using the login button on the main page
    * You can refresh the token using the refresh token button in case it expires
    * You can logout using the logout button on the main page
    * You can perform all actions using the fronent (provided that you use the correct account role)

### Weird specifications:
    Due to my limited ability to handle frontend calls using AJAX, each page has 2 endpoints:
    * One loader page (requires no auth and it calls instantly the actual page)
    * The actual page (contains the correct data and requires proper auth)
    This was done due to certain issues with JWT storage in the local storage.

## Backend
### What is a Job (model)?
    A job is the representation that a sales agent is currently trying to sell a house to potential clients.
    A job is a direct relationship between one specific agent and one specific house.
    An agent can sell multiple houses but a house can be sold by many agents.
### Why a many to many relationship?
    I used a many to many relationship in order to be able to extend the Job model to include (in the future) many data attributes that has no relation with the house or the agent models, and since each house can be handled by an agent, it would seem appropriate to use a one to one relationship but this would not allow to extend the app's functions in a smooth way (data architecture speaking).
    Also a job has no id, the primary keys in a job are the id of the agent and the house.
